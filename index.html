					<h1><code>Flexbox</code></h1>
					<h3 class="fragment">Why flexbox is awesome.</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						Flexbox is amazing. There are so many quirks that you can run into on a daily basis with CSS and they can sometimes cause serious headaches. Flex is here to
						make our lives a little easier.
				</section>

				<section data-background="">
					<h2>The Problem</h2>

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Current layouts rely on 'hacks'</li>
						<li class="fragment">Floats and table cells</li>
						<li class="fragment">Inline for horizontal elements</li>
						<li class="fragment">Block for vertical elements</li>

					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						The problem that flexbox is trying to solve revolves around the fact that the current state of layout techniques with css relies
						heavily on 'hacks.' A lot of the current techniques like floats and table cells arent typically meant for things like grids or alignment
						css also lacks a direction agnostic display type. You can specify directions with inline or block but those have their own set of quirks.
						Flex is here to fix all that.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>A versatile tool</h2>
					<p>
						Flexbox offers tools to tackle a large range of problems including:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Navigation</li>
						<li class="fragment">Inline Forms</li>
						<li class="fragment">Page components/Elements</li>
						<li class="fragment">Alignment Issues</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						It provides tons of tools for making things like navigation, pagination, headers/footers, galleries, and many other things simpler.
						Like any new web technology there is a lag in adoption with older browsers, and various quirks to look out for. Overall its a fantastic tool that will make your life on the front end considerably easier.

						<h2>Browser Support</h2>
						<figure>
							<img src="images/browser-usage.png" alt="">
							<figcaption>Usage relative browser support</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<aside class="notes">
							This picture shows ups that support for flexbox is nearly universal at this point. IE 8 and 9 are the last two browsers that have no support at all for it, how ever
							microsoft has done us all a favor and killed these. Looking at IE 10 + youll notice it only has partial support, thats because they implemented an older specification from 2012.
							Many of the same core concepts and techniques still work, you will just need to look for alternative properties that IE 10 might use.
						</aside>

					</section>
					<section data-background="http://i.giphy.com/QyrysGo7Hz70I.gif">

						<aside class="notes">
							Basically, youre good to go. Unless you need to support old browsers, I highly suggest using flex on your next project.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Good support with a few gotcha's:</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>No IE 8 or 9</li>
							<li>IE 10 and 11 support old syntax</li>
							<li>Vendor Prefixes</li>
							<li>Android Stock Browser quirks</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							A couple other caveats that should be noted before diving in with flexbox is that is requires some seriously heavy vendor prefixing. Luckily gulp autoprefixer is a thing
							that makes your life in this respect cake. I wouldnt suggest using flexbox without it unless you love typing '-webkit' over and over. Additionally there are some odd quirks
							that the android native browser has with flex, ill go into more detail on this later
						</aside>

					<h2>The basics</h2>
					<img src="images/flexbox.png" alt="" />
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Direction specifies main axis</li>
						<li class="fragment">Justify works on main axis</li>
						<li class="fragment">Align works on opposite axis</li>
						<li class="fragment">Basis defines starting size</li>
						<li class="fragment">Grow and shrink work with remaining space</li>

					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						Lets go over the basics. Flexbox is built using an intuitive x and y axis. A main axis is defined for the flex container,
						and things like alignment and ability to change width or height is relative to that axis.
						You specify the main axis with flex-direction. you can align content along that axis with justify-content. You can align content
						along the opposite axis with align items and content. You can specify initial sizing with flex-basis, and you can tell the children
						what to do with the remaining space using grow and shrink.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background="http://i.giphy.com/VHngktboAlxHW.gif">
					
					<aside class="notes">
						The basics are pretty simple, however Flexbox is basically magic. That magic really shines through when you leverage the power of auto-adjusting heights, and flex wraps
						that do away with the need for complex breakpoints and grid layouts.

						<h2>When to use flexbox?</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							There are a few use cases that flexbox is a god send for. It can do everything from page layouts to element alignment, but it really shines in
							a few scenarios. DONT use it for overall page layouts. Its a little clunky in that sort of scenario, how ever
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Navigation</h2>
						<h3>(or pagination)</h3>
						<img src="images/sample-nav.png" alt="">
						<pre>
							<code data-trim data-noescape>
.nav {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: space-around;
}

.nav-item {
    flex-grow: 1;
    justify-content: center;
}
							</code>
						</pre>
						<aside class="notes">
							First use is navigation. It adds a few quality of life improvements that are simply difficult to live without once you start using them.
							This is a simple fairly standard looking nav. Its not complicated to make, and is traditonally done using floats, display inline-block, or display table-cell.
							Most useful when an unknown number of elements are at play. (next)
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Mobile Navigation</h2>
						<img src="images/sample-nav2.png" alt="" height="200px">
						<pre>
							<code data-trim data-noescape>
.nav {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: space-around;
}

@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
    .nav {
        flex-direction: row;
    }
}
							</code>
						</pre>
						<aside class="notes">
					        We can take this flex based nav one step further and set it up for mobile use simply by changing the flex-direction property. No fumbling with changing the display or clearing floats.
							The main advantage here is that flex doesnt need to know the number of children, it will fit all children proportionally (using space-around) in
							the remaining space
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Galleries</h2>
						<img src="images/gallery.png" alt="" height="500px">

						<aside class="notes">
					        A major advantage of using flexbox when you have a large number of items with variable content that need to be equal heights is being able
							to set all children to grow to the height of the container without exclusively setting a height.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Galleries</h2>
						<pre>
							<code data-trim data-noescape>
.second-gallery .column-gallery-item {
  width: 32.20339%;
  float: left;
}
.second-gallery .column-gallery-item:nth-child(3n + 1) {
  margin-left: 0;
  margin-right: -100%;
  clear: both;
  margin-left: 0;
}
.second-gallery .column-gallery-item:nth-child(3n + 2) {
  margin-left: 33.89831%;
  margin-right: -100%;
  clear: none;
}
.second-gallery .column-gallery-item:nth-child(3n + 3) {
  margin-left: 67.79661%;
  margin-right: -100%;
  clear: none;
}
							</code>
						</pre>
						<aside class="notes">
							This is what the css might look like on an image grid not using flex. Negative margins and floats/clears provide for some pretty unreadable styles
							This also doesnt take into account that heights between siblings can vary which is another beast all together without using absolute heights and overflows
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Galleries</h2>

						<pre>
							<code data-trim data-noescape>
.gallery {
	display: flex;
	flex-direction: row;
	justify-content: space-between;
	flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.gallery-item {
	flex-basis: 33%;
	flex-grow: 1;
}
							</code>
						</pre>
						<aside class="notes">
							Oviously theres a little more going on here css wise but this is all you need to create fluid gallery layouts. Traditionaly grid layouts done with
							flex require using the clearfix or adding negative margins to fix floating issues. Flex takes care of this by simply defining flex-wrap: wrap;
							clearing its siblings properly. Additionally flexbox takes care of ensuring that all children are equal heights. No more padding hacks or overflow tricks.
							One major advantage of creating galleries this way is that flex-wrap does away with the need for complex media queries since the browser will automatically reflow and expand all children
							as necessary.

						<h2>Layout Techniques</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							Flex has tons of applications in front end developing if you get a little creative with it. There are a good amount of weird layout quirks youve probably run into
							more than once, flexbox offers a ton of solutions to a lot of really common problems
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Horizontal & Vertical Center</h2>

					<pre>
						<code>
.center-vert {
	display: flex;
	align-items: center;
}

.center-horizontal {
	display: flex;
	justify-content: center;
}

.center-both {
	display: flex;
	justify-content: center;
	align-items: center;
}
						</code>
					</pre>

						<aside class="notes">
							Centering in layouts is generally fairly simple, how ever it can get tricky when floats are applied or any sort of positioning comes into play.
							Flexbox offers a quick way to center in any position, even inline elements. No tables or table-cells required
							the main work being done here is justify-content and align-items. justify-content works along main axis, align-items works on the opposite
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Flex Grids</h2>

						<pre>
							<code>
.grid {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.grid-item {
    flex-basis: 33%;
    flex-basis: percentage(1/3);
    flex: 0 0 33%;
}
							</code>
						</pre>

						<aside class="notes">
							Lets talk about grids.
							Flexbox is great for creating simple grid based layouts. Bootstrap and foundations have already made moves to support using flexbox, but its just as easy to roll your own.
							As noted earlier flex-basis can be used to set the width of the grid item, and setting the container to wrap allows for infinite amounts of children.
							Lets take a second to address this flex shorthand. Using "flex" like this you can specify flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex basis all in one line.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Visual Order</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Flexbox is order agnostic</p>
						<pre class="fragment">
							<code>
.container {
	flex-direction: row-reverse;
}
							</code>
						</pre>
						<pre class="fragment">
							<code>
.error {
	order: 1;
}
							</code>
						</pre>

						<aside class="notes">
							Another fantastic feature of flexbox is that its source order agnostic. That means if you need to reflow a layout at different screen sizes,
							or you need quick client side ordering, flex can be used to arrange elements in any order despite their order in the document.
							Adding reverse to either direction will automatically rearrange all children in reverse order. This could be helpful for Z-A style filtering
							Additionally, the order property can be applied to any child of a flex container to arrange contents in a custom order. This could definitely come in handy
							if you are trying to bump error messages to the top of a list.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Sticky Footer</h2>
						<img src="images/viewport-height.png" alt="">

						<aside class="notes">
							One common problem that requires a workaround is making the footer sticky to the bottom of the screen regardless of how little content is in the body.
							This gets messy fast requiring things like negative margins and percentage based padding or tables. What is this, 2013?
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Sticky Footer</h2>
						<pre>
							<code>
body {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    min-height: 100vh;
}

.body-wrapper {
    flex: 1 0 auto;
}
							</code>
						</pre>

						<h2>Common Gotchas</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							You got to be careful with flex, or you are going to start running into walls. One thing to keep in mind when working with flexbox is that some browsers only support the old syntax. Additionally,
							the level of vendor prefixing necessary is mind boggling. Its hard to keep track of all of the different syntax on top of all the
							prefixes.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Prefixes &amp; Syntax</h2>

						<img src="images/prefixing.png" alt="">
						<aside class="notes">
							Luckily if calibrated properly, autoprefixer will do almost all of the heavy lifting for us. It knows exactly which syntax and prefix to use
							and will do a lot of the dirty work when it comes to browser compatibility. As always though there should be tons of cross browser testing due to its
							dynamic and unstable state.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Autoprefixer</h2>
						<h3 class="fragment">(you're going to need it)</h3>

						<pre class="fragment">
							<code>
.plans {
display: -webkit-box;
display: -webkit-flex;
display: -ms-flexbox;
display: flex; }
.plans > div {
-webkit-box-flex: 1;
-webkit-flex: 1 1 33%;
-ms-flex: 1 1 33%;
flex: 1 1 33%;
display: -webkit-box;
display: -webkit-flex;
display: -ms-flexbox;
display: flex;
-webkit-box-orient: vertical;
-webkit-box-direction: normal;
-webkit-flex-direction: column;
-ms-flex-direction: column;
flex-direction: column;
-webkit-box-align: start;
-webkit-align-items: flex-start;
-ms-flex-align: start;
align-items: flex-start; }
.plans > div .stretch {
width: 100%;
-webkit-box-flex: 1;
-webkit-flex: 1 0 auto;
-ms-flex: 1 0 auto;
flex: 1 0 auto; }
							</code>
						</pre>
						<aside class="notes">
							This is some sample css spit out by auto prefixer. Its ugly and huge and no one in their right mind would ever want to write this by hand.
							Moral of the story is, use autoprefixer or you are going to be in trouble.
						</aside>

					<section>
						<h2>Browser Quirks</h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">IE 10+ min-height/max-height issues</li>
							<li class="fragment">Android Stock browser weirdness < 4.4</li>
							<li class="fragment">Old versions of Firefox (we are talking really old) dont support flex-wrap</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Since flexible box has been changed so many times and implemented so many ways in different browsers, it leaves a mine field of odd browser quirks to watch out for
							Some noteable quirks include setting min-height on flex items in internet explorer prevents its children from seeing its height.
							Android stock browsers have issues with certain space-around/between declerations below version 4.4 (came out late 2013).
							Additionally, firefox 27 and below dont support flex-wrap, but thats pretty much a non-issue

						<aside class="notes">
							You may be wondering, is there a pollyfill? That answer is yes!!! Sort of... there is an (extremely buggy) pollyfill supporting the old syntax for IE 8

					<section>
						<h2>Dont Bother</h2>
						<h4 class="fragment">(Internet explorer is lame)</h4>
						<aside class="notes">
							If you have to develop for older versions of IE, id say dont bother with trying to get flexbox to work. youll most likely end up spending
							more time than you save. Luckily microsoft has done us a large favor and killed off older versions of IE. Flex is in your future!

						<h2>Complex Layouts</h2>
						<iframe src="http://output.jsbin.com/iYEmaTUF/3" width="100%" height="400px"></iframe>
						<a href="http://output.jsbin.com/iYEmaTUF/3">source</a>
						<aside class="notes">
							The biggest upside of flex, the fact that it lets content dictate the layout can also cause some issues. Due to the fact that it is agnostic to the number of children
							allowing items to fill their container can force reflows on slow connections. If you think of a massive content area with rich media and a small sidebar, which ever is first
							in the layout will fill the screen and then reflow once information further on the page is received. Obviously this is only apparent on very slow connections, but can be an issue
							depending on the site. This is a fairly basic example of that, but you can imagine on heavier pages this could cause serious issues.
